# Ali Jafarbeglou's Portfolio

Welcome to the source repository for my personal portfolio website. This site is a comprehensive showcase of my skills, projects, and artwork as a self-taught software developer and designer. It features a responsive design, a toggle for dark/light mode, and custom-designed banners created using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

## Features

- Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless viewing experience across a variety of devices and screen sizes.
- Dark/Light Mode: Allows users to switch between themes for comfortable readability.
- Custom Graphics: All banners and visuals are personally designed, displaying a blend of technical and creative prowess.
- Technologies Used: Built with HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JavaScript for interactivity.

## Usage

The website is structured into several sections including:


- **Landing Page: Introduces my name and title with a compelling tagline.
- **About: Shares my journey and the essence of my passion for technology and design.
- **Skills: Highlights the technologies and tools I'm proficient in.
- **Portfolio: A gallery of my projects, each with descriptions, images, and links to live sites or code repositories.
- **Contact: Provides a way for potential clients or employers to reach out to me.

Toggle the moon/sun icon to switch between dark and light mode to your preference.
